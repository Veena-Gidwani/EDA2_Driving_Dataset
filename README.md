# EDA_Driving_Dataset
 Second Basic Exploratory Data Analysis on a Driving Dataset Using python
## Police Traffic Stop Data Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook performs an exploratory analysis of a police traffic stop dataset. 

**Key Libraries:**

* pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis

**Data Cleaning:**

1. **Missing Value Removal:** The script identifies and removes columns containing only missing values (commented out as this step might have already been performed on the provided data).

**Data Analysis:**

2. **Speeding Violations by Gender:** Analyzes which gender receives more speeding tickets.

3. **Search Rates by Gender:** Investigates if search rates differ based on the driver's gender.

4. **Average Stop Duration:** Calculates the mean stop duration by converting textual categories into numerical values.

5. **Age Distribution by Violation:** Compares the age distribution of drivers pulled over for different violations using descriptive statistics.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install pandas library using `pip install pandas`.
3. Ensure you have the traffic stop data file (`PROJECT3.csv`) in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

The results will be displayed within the notebook.

**Note:**

* This is a basic analysis. Further exploration can be done on factors influencing stop duration, search rates, etc.

I hope this provides a good starting point for your README file!
